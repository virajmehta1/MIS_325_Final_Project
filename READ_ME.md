Project Description: This is a text-based military adventure game where the scenario finds you behind enemy lines. 
You have a choice to make, and based on that choice you will go down a path that will ultimately determine your fate.

How to run program: To run the program simply load up the python file. Once you run the program you will be displayed 
text that describes the situation. You will then be asked to make a choice of 1 or 2(choose a path). Once you choose a 
path more text will display to describe your ultimate fate. After that you can play the game again by typing "y" or "yes." 
If you would like to exit the game, simply type anything other than "yes" or "y."
